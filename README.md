# AlgoVisualization
Tests on Algorithms Visualization with potential of interaction
# DFS
DFS Algorithm visualization, mouse click once for setting start point(green);
Mouse click second time for setting target(red);
Then, mouse click for setting obstacles(orange),searching path can not go through obstacles,
Add some obstacles to see how the DFS searching works while interact with it!
When backtracking happen, color change to highlight,so you can see how DFS backtracking during the searching.
